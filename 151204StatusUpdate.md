# Gilmore Lab Projects  

## EEG Projects
- update protocols
  - Calibrate-Monitor.md
  - Post-session-protocol-high-density-eeg.md
  - ssvep-high-density-setup.md
  - mofo-3-pattern-psychophysics **completed**
  
 
## MOFO Child Tuning
### Goal
Collect data from 25 participants
### Participants
- 10 previous Participants  
- 27 additional participants  
- all demographic data is located on databrary: https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/144

### Data Processing
- 10 participants reprocessed with PD Video  
  - Raw Threshold Detector = 60 / Blink Threshold = 60  
  - Raw Threshold Detector = 100 / Blink Threshold = 100 
- additional participants processed with PD Video using two threshold detector settings
  - Raw Threshold Detector = 60 / Blink Threshold = 60
  - Raw Threshold Detector = 100 / Blink Threshold = 100  

### To Do
- **completed** Create R script to prepare output files from PD Video for the analysis script pipeline - R script converted from moco  
 
 
- fix R script to run as a function through all datasets in the sessions folder
   
- **Completed** Reprocess the 10 previous participants at the settings Raw Threshold Detector = 100 / Blink Threshold = 100
  - *Difficulty: After copying the data from Box to the PowerBook G4, no files are showing up in PD Video, just directories. However everything shows up in the Finder Window.*
     - raw data was copied from data collection computers and completely reprocessed.
  
## MOCO INF_2Pat_LamRad

- all demographic data is located on databrary: https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/146

### Data Processing
- 5 participants processed with PD Video  
  - Raw Threshold Detector = 200 / Blink Threshold = 200
