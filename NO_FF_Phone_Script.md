#Steady-State Evoked Potential Responses to Visual Stimulation in Children and Adults  

##This script is to be used when contacting families that are **NOT** a part of FIRSt Families Database.  

The goal of this conversation is to provide the potential participant’s parent(s) with study information, answer any questions they may have, collect prescreening information over the phone, and if they are eligible, schedule them for a lab visit.  

“Hello my name is **[your name]**. I am calling on behalf of the Brain Development Laboratory at Penn State may I speak to **[Mother’s name]** or **[Father’s name]**?”  
- If parent confirms their presence continue with the script  
- If parent isn’t available, say "I would like to call back at a more convenient time. When would be a good time to call? (Parent answers). Very good, I will make a note and have someone call you back then. Thank you. Good-bye." 

IF PARENT IS HOME AND AVAILABLE TO SPEAK
“Hello, how are you this evening?  I am calling to follow up on the letter we sent recently about a study of visual perception. We would like to invite [name of child] to participate. Is this a good time to talk about the study?

- If YES continue with the script  
- If NO ask “Would you be interested in joining FIRSt families database so that you can be contacted for future studies by other researchers at Penn State?”  
  - If YES or NO make note of this in the **additional information** column on the Excel spreadsheet'
  - If NO for FIRSt Families say “Thank you for your time.”  
  
IF PARENT EXPRESSES INTEREST  
"I'm glad you're interested. The study focuses on how the brain responds to visual information and how brain responses change as children mature.  During the visit, your child will be given a brief vision screen. Then we will record the brain's natural electrical signals while your child watches dot displays on a computer screen.  It would take about one hour in total, and we would provide you with a thank you gift of $10. If you are interested, I would need more information about [child’s name] to determine if [he/she] is eligible for the study. 

“Is your [child's name] birthdate **[state child’s date of birth]** ?”  
"Was [child's name] born prematurely?"  
"Does [child's name] have any serious medical or visual problems?"  
"Does [child's name] have a history of epilepsy?"  
"Has [child's name] ever experienced a seizure while **[he/she]** was watching TV, movies, or a computer screen, or during another illness?"  

IF PARENT ANSWERS YES TO ONE OR MORE SCREENING QUESTIONS
“I am sorry but your child is not eligible to participate in our study, thank you so much for your time. Good-bye”

IF PARENT ANSWERS **NO** TO ALL QUESTIONS  
"Your child qualifies for our study. Would you like to schedule a visit?"

"We have appointments available on {state next set of available appointments}. What would be most convenient for you? That’s great. 
  - Please check the psugilmorelab gmail calendar. 
  - Available timeslots are listed as 'EEG Timeslot - Open


~Visits last 1-1.5 hours, when scheduling more than one visit per day, leave at least 30 minutes between appointments~

- Once a timeslot is selected say “Your appointment is [day of the week], [date], [time]”  

Determine whether the parent will need childcare from our lab on the day of the visit:  
- “Do you have other children that you will be bringing to the visit?  If so, how many children and what are their ages?”
- "Let me tell you how to get to the lab and where we will meet you."
FOR STUDIES AT THE MOORE BUILDING  
"The lab is located in the Moore Building. We’re not far from the Nittany Lion Inn. Do you know where the Allen Street entrance is to campus off of Park Avenue? Moore is on Fischer Road, the first right after you turn on Allen from Park. Moore is the first tall building on your left. We’ll have a researcher meet you there and give you a parking pass for the Nittany Lion parking deck."  
FOR STUDIES AT SLEIC  
"The lab is located in Chandlee Lab. We’re in the middle of campus, across Pollock Road from Old Main. Do you know where the Shortlidge Street entrance is to campus off of College Avenue? Take Shortledge until the T-intersection with Pollock Road. Turn left. Tell the Parking Attendant at the Kiosk that you are coming to Chandlee Lab for an appointment at the imaging center. 

We’ll have a researcher meet you there and give you a parking pass. 
- After confirmation say “We would like to send you a map and directions to our center do you have an email address that we can send it to?”**

- Ask for a description of parent’s car “What is the make, model, and color of your car?”

- After you get the email ask “Would you be interested in joining FIRSt families database so that you can be contacted for future studies by other researchers at Penn State?”  
  - If YES type Wants to join FIRSt Families in the **additional information** column on the Excel spreadsheet  
  - If NO type Does not want to join FIRSt Families in the **additional information** column on the Excel spreadsheet  

 “Thank you for scheduling an appointment with us, we look forward  to seeing you at the lab”
