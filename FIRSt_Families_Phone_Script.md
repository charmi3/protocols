Steady-State Evoked Potential Responses to Visual Stimulation in Children and Adults
This script is to be used when contacting families that are a part of FIRSt Families Database. The goal of this conversation is to provide the potential participant’s parent(s) with study information, answer any questions they may have, collect prescreening information over the phone, and if they are eligible, schedule them for a lab visit.
“Hello my name is   (your name) I am calling on behalf of the Brain Development Laboratory at Penn State may I speak to (Mother’s name) or (Father’s name)?”
-If parent confirms their presence continue with the script
- If parent isn’t available, say “I’ll call back at another time.”
“Hello, how are you this evening?  I am calling to inform you about a study we are conducting in the brain development lab. In our study, we are investigating how the brain responds to visual information and how this response develops from infancy to adulthood. We are currently recruiting infants and children and I would like to know if you are interested in letting your child participate?”
- If YES continue with the script
- If NO say “Thank you for your time.”
“I’m glad you’re interested. During the visit, your child will be given a brief vision screen. Then we will record the natural signals given off by the brain while your child watches dot displays on a computer screen.  The  visit  will last approximately 1 hour. Before your child can participate in our study I need to ask you some questions:  
“Is your child’s name (state child’s name) ?”
“Is your child’s birthdate (state child’s date of birth) ?”
“If you answer yes to any of the following questions, your child we will not be able to participate in our study.”
Was your child was born prematurely?
Does your child have any serious medical or visual problems?
Does your child have a history of epilepsy?
 Has your child ever experienced a seizure while he or she was watching TV, movies, or a computer screen, or during another illness?
If child is eligible say “Your child qualifies for our study would you like to schedule a visit?”
If child is NOT eligible say “I am sorry but your child is not eligible to participate in our study, thank you so much for your time.”
Inform parent(s) of the available timeslots: 
Tuesdays (Times between 11:15AM-12:00PM, 4:00-5:00PM)
Wednesdays (Times between 9:30AM-10:00AM,3:30-4:30PM)
Thursdays (Times between 9:30AM-10:00AM,12:00-12:30PM)
Fridays (Times between 10:00-11:00AM,12:30-1:30PM)
Saturdays (Times between 10:30AM-4:00PM)
     
~Visits last 1-1.5 hours, when scheduling more than one visit per day, leave at least 30 minutes between appointments~

Once a timeslot is selected say “Your appointment is ( day of the week), (date), (time)”**

Determine whether the parent will need childcare from our lab on the day of the visit:  “Do you have other children that you will be bringing to the visit?  If so, how many children and what are their ages?”**

After confirmation say “We would like to send you a map and directions to our center do you have an email address that we can send it to?”**

Ask for a description of parent’s car “What is the make, model, and color of your car?”


“Thank you for scheduling an appointment with us, we look forward  to seeing you at the lab”
