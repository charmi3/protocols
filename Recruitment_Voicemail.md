Hello, my name is [your name] from the Brain Development Laboratory at Penn State. I received your contact information from the FIRSt Families Database and would like to know if you are interested in having your child [name of infant/child] participate in an 1 hour research study. During this time we will observe how the brain responds to visual information using EEG. If you are interested, please contact the lab at 814-863-3116. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!
