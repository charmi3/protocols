Hello, my name is [your name] from the Brain Development Laboratory at Penn State and I am calling to follow up on the letter we sent recentl. I received your contact information from the FIRSt Families Database. Would you be interested in having your child [name of infant/child] participate in an 1 hour research study where we will observe how the brain responds to visual information [using EEG]. If you are interested, please contact the lab at 814-863-3116. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!
