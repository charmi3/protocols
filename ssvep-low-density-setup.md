## Low-Density VEP Set-Up Checklist

### COMPUTERS

- In room H, switch on power of large surge protector on bottom left shelf.

- Switch on power of smaller, thin surge protector (ignore green lights; always on).

- Turn on PD Video, Link 15, and PD Host computers, and both monitors.

- If either monitor screen in unresponsive, you may need to toggle to the correct computer via the gray KVM switches on the top left (PD Video / Link 15) and right (NetStation  / PD Host) shelf.

- Turn on external timebase, behind the monitors (switch is back, right side).

- Make sure that white round switch on top of the left KVM switch is set to A.

- Keep the plug in the external timebase outlet labeled OUT.

- Log onto the Link 15 computer and use account name rog1, password Chandlee1(symbol) *Check yellow post-it next to keyboard*

- Launch Link 15 software (icon with yellow triangle). In Model 15 menu, go to Connect, and choose appropriate setting. Make sure the window to the right says “Connected,” If so, hit Use button on the left.

- On PD Video computer, open Power Diva Video 3.4 software

- In Power Diva Video, go to Configuration --> Video Manager. In "Mode" window, make sure our calibrated video setting of "80- x 600, 72 Hz, 8 bit" is selected. 

- On PD Host computer, open Power Diva Host 3.4 software. (icon says alias)

- Go to New Session, fill out session info, and choose the appropriate session models.

### ELECTRODES

- In cabinet in120H, retrieve set of 5 electrodes, a paper towel, and a pack of earplugs.

- In 120G, set up work station with NuPrep gel, 102- paste, calipers, measuring tape, red pencil, 1 piece electrical tape, 7 squares of cut cloth, Q-tips, vet wrap, and the impedance meter.  
	
- Measure subject’s head circumference. Set calipers to 1/2- of the circumference.

- Measure and mark for Cz.

- Use electrical tape to fasten electrodes to subject’s right shoulder.
	
- Apply white electrode to Cz. Remember to exfoliate scalp with gel before applying.

- Using Cz as a reference for centering, place orange electrode at Oz (one caliper measurement up from the peak of the inion).

- Place the rest of the electrodes, making sure the cups are aligned to Oz. (order from L-R: brown, red, orange, yellow, green)

- Measure Impedance. (white goes in position 1). Adjust channels over 10kOHM. 

- Use vetrap to keep electrodes in place (1 around, 1 over).

- Plug electrodes into the green GRASS box connected to subject chair (match the corresponding colors).

- In Power Diva Host, press Mon button and view raw EEG waveforms to ensure connection.

- Measure distance and adjust monitor as necessary.

- Hand subject the game controller, and instruct them to use button R1 to trigger onset of stimulus, and record. 

- Give earplugs to participant.
- Using Power Diva Host, change conditions when necessary.
