## Low-Density VEP Set-Up Checklist

### COMPUTERS

- In room G, turn on the CRT Monitor

- In room H, switch on power of large surge protector on bottom left shelf.

- On the second shelf, switch on power of smaller, thin surge protector (ignore green lights; always on).

- Turn on PD Video, Link 15, and PD Host computers, and both monitors.

- If either monitor screen in unresponsive, you may need to toggle to the correct computer via the **gray KVM switches** on the top left (PD Video / Link 15) and right (NetStation  / PD Host) shelf.

- Turn on external timebase, behind the monitors (switch is back, right side).

- Make sure that white round switch on top of the left KVM switch is set to A.

- Keep the plug in the external timebase outlet labeled OUT.

- Log onto the Link 15 computer and use account name **rog1**, password **Chandlee1)**

- Launch Link 15 software (icon with yellow triangle). In **Model 15** menu, go to **Connect**, and choose appropriate setting. 
  - infant.set
  - adult.set
  - ONE15A54.set (what is this?)
- Make sure the window to the right says **Connected**, If so, hit **Use** button on the left.

- Using KVM switch, toggle from **Link 15** computer to **PD Video** computer.
- On PD Video computer, open Power Diva Video 3.4 software

- In Power Diva Video, go to Configuration --> Video Manager. In **Mode** window, make sure our calibrated video setting of "800 x 600, 72 Hz, 8 bit" is selected.

### ELECTRODES

- In 120HA, retrieve set of 5 electrodes, a paper towel, and a pack of earplugs.

- In 120G, set up work station with NuPrep gel, 1020 paste, calipers, measuring tape, red pencil, 1 piece electrical tape, 7 squares of cut cloth, Q-tips, vet wrap, and the impedance meter.  
	
- Measure subject’s head circumference (in centimeters). Set calipers to 1/20 of the circumference.

- Measure and mark for Cz.

- Use electrical tape to fasten electrodes to subject’s right shoulder.
	
- Apply white electrode to Cz. Remember to exfoliate scalp with gel before applying.

- Using Cz as a reference for centering, place orange electrode at Oz (one caliper measurement up from the peak of the inion).

- Place the rest of the electrodes, making sure the cups are aligned to Oz. (order from L-R: brown, red, orange, yellow, green) Remember by the saying "**BRO Y**ou're **G**ood"

- Measure Impedance. (white goes in position 1). Adjust channels over 10kOHM.

- Use vetrap to keep electrodes in place (1 around, 1 over).

- Plug electrodes into the green GRASS box connected to subject chair (match the corresponding colors).

- In Power Diva Host, press **Mon** button and view raw EEG waveforms to ensure connection.

- Measure distance (60 cm from nasion) and adjust monitor as necessary.

- Hand subject the game controller, and instruct them to use button R1 to trigger onset of stimulus, and a second time to record. 

- Give earplugs to participant.
- Using Power Diva Host, change conditions when necessary.
